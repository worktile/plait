  <h2>
    A modern drawing framework for building an all-in-one whiteboard tool </br>
    for interactive drawing features such as mind maps, flowcharts, and freehand drawing.
  </h3>
</div>


Plait is a modern drawing framework that provides a plugin mechanism, allowing developers to extend drawing functionalities through plugins. It is particularly suitable for the development of interactive whiteboard tools.


Plait does not rely on any frontend UI framework at its core, but it provides solutions for integrating with mainstream frontend UI frameworks to ensure a good development experience for upper-layer developers and to reuse mainstream framework components.


[‰∏≠ÊñáÊñáÊ°£](https://github.com/worktile/plait/blob/develop/README.zh-CN.md)

Plait will also provide some basic functional plugins, which have been implemented so far:

- Mind plugin

- Draw plugin

- Knowledge graph plugin

- Flow plugin

#### Features

- Independent of UI frameworks
- Provides basic board capabilities, such as zooming in, zooming out, and moving
- Plugin mechanism
- Data model (supports collaboration)
- Basic drawing utility functions


#### UI Framework Integration

The implementation of the framework requires components from frontend UI frameworks as carriers. This ensures that the development of drawing functionalities follows mainstream development patterns (data-driven). Currently, integration with Angular and React frameworks is supported.

Text rendering in the plait is based on the Slate framework, enabling rich text rendering and editing on the board. Slate is an excellent rich text editor framework, and Plait was inspired by the Slate framework in its design

### Development

```
npm i

npm run build

npm run start
```


### Usage

Basic usage (integrated @plait/mind plugin)

HTMLÔºö

```
<plait-board [plaitPlugins]="plugins" [plaitValue]="value"
    (plaitBoardInitialized)="plaitBoardInitialized($event)" (onChange)="change($event)">
</plait-board>
```

TSÔºö

```
// .ts
@Component({
  selector: 'board-basic',
  templateUrl: './board-basic.component.html',
  host: {
    class: 'board-basic-container',
  },
})
export class BasicBoardComponent {
  plugins = [withMind];

  value: PlaitElement[] = demoData;

  board!: PlaitBoard;

  change(event: OnChangeData) {
    // console.log(event.children);
  }

  plaitBoardInitialized(value: PlaitBoard) {
    this.board = value;
  }
}
```
